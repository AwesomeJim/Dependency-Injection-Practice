Dependency Injection
------
Dependency injection (DI) is a technique widely used in programming and well suited to Android development. 
By following the principles of DI, you lay the groundwork for a good app architecture.

Implementing dependency injection provides you with the following advantages:

    Reusability of code.
    Ease of refactoring.
    Ease of testing.
I have always seen Dependency injection (DI) with [Dagger2](https://dagger.dev/) as the big Elephant in the room, I made a decision to address this elephant once and for all. 
I found it easier starting off with Dagger Implementation in Java, then Dagger in Kotlin and finally the new google recommended DI for Android [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) in Kotlin 

Dagger2 In Java
---------
I found a very useful blog by [CodingFlow](https://codinginflow.com/tutorials/android/dagger-2) which gave me a very good lift off, very simple,clear and awesome implementation.

 Dagger2 in Kotlin
 ----------
After  grasping the whole concept of Dagger in Java it was time to jump into my favorite train of Kotlin.
For Kotlin google have a very awesome documentation and a codelab. I took the codeLab

Hilt Codelabs
------------
To implement hilt I had two approach,
